abstract: Scholars of television in the United States have noted an undercurrent
  of self-reflexivity in the early sitcom, typically understood as techniques
  that call attention to the medium’s artifice and the apparatus of television
  itself. However, one aspect of self-reflexivity in early television sitcom
  that warrants deeper analysis is the use of parafiction, or the deliberate
  blurring of the boundary between reality and artifice. The show that most
  greatly exemplifies the use of parafiction in early television is The George
  Burns and Gracie Allen Show (1950–1958), in which Burns and Allen play
  themselves as a pair of married entertainers. The show borrows heavily from
  their real lives, makes frequent reference to their careers, and further calls
  attention to its self-reflexivity through a narrative device that sees Burns’
  character literally step out of the set and address the home audience
  directly. Burns and Allen maintained elaborate parafictional personas that
  inflected their public image throughout their lives, and the extent to which
  they broke down the division between truth and fiction in their lives and work
  makes George Burns and Gracie Allen perhaps the earliest and most significant
  practitioners of parafictional persona in American screen comedy.
