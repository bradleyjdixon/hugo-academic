  *The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show* (1950–1958) portrays the domestic
  life of its titular comedians as a pair of married vaudeville and radio
  entertainers. Replicating the dynamic of their own successful vaudeville and
  radio double act, Burns plays the put-upon but patient straight man, leaving
  most of the comedic heavy lifting to Allen, whose performance as a ditzy ‘dumb
  Dora’ archetype belies a sophisticated humour based on word play and multiple
  meaning. One aspect of the show largely overlooked by scholars is its
  extensive and, for the time, radical use of meta and self- referential humour.
  Borrowing heavily from Burns and Allen’s real lives, the show was set in their
  home at 312 Maple Drive, Beverly Hills, with a living room and kitchen set
  closely modelled on their own, and their characters’ jobs as entertainers
  mirrored their own professional history. Often, Burns’ character would
  literally step out of the set, look into the camera, and address the home
  audience directly, commenting and making jokes about the events of the episode
  as a stand-up comedian would. By modelling their characters’ lives so closely
  on their own, and by playing with self-referential humour so extensively,
  Burns and Allen can be considered an early example of parafiction in screen
  media. Parafiction, a term used to describe performers appearing as
  ‘themselves’ in fictional media (Warren 2016), creates a complex diegetic
  relationship between the fictional and the real. This paper, a historical
  re-examination of the show as well as similar sitcoms starring Jack Benny and
  Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, makes the case that the 1950s sitcom represents the
  previously unacknowledged beginning of the tradition of parafiction in
  television, and traces its influence through to some of the most celebrated
  parafictional television shows of the modern era, including *It’s Garry
  Shandling’s Show* (1986– 1990), *Seinfeld* (1989–1998), and *Curb Your
  Enthusiasm* (2000–present).
