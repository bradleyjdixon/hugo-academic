abstract: Critical readings of the bromance film genre – as typified by Judd
  Apatow’s *The 40-Year-Old Virgin* (2005) – often focus on how such films
  ostensibly reconfigure the tropes of the romantic comedy away from privileging
  heterosexual coupledom and towards platonic male friendship. The romantic
  comedy has long been identified as an agent of neoliberal ideology by
  emphasising the primacy of the stable, monogamous, child-producing,
  male-female relationship. Bromance films, by diminishing the importance of
  male-female relationships in favour of platonic male friendship, appeared to
  flip this script and use the tropes of the romantic comedy to challenge the
  venerated position of heterosexual coupledom in society. However, through
  close analysis of *The 40-Year-Old Virgin*, this paper will show that bromance
  films are in fact comprehensively encoded with the signs and signifiers of
  neoliberalism and that these films, far from criticising the dominant
  ideology, actually strongly reinforce it.
