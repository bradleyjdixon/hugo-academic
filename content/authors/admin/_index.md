Hello, I’m **Bradley J. Dixon**. I’m a writer, critic, film programmer, radio host and audio producer from Melbourne, Australia.

I’m a former editor of the film journal *[Senses of Cinema](http://www.sensesofcinema.com/)* and co-founder and editor of *The Essential*, a two-time AFCA Award winning online publication of film and music criticism. As a freelance critic, my writing on cinema and pop culture has been published in *Bright Wall/Dark Room*, *Junkee*, *Film Blerg* and elsewhere.

I am a member of the [Australian Film Critics Association](http://www.auscritic.com/) and the committee of the [Melbourne Cinémathèque](http://www.melbournecinematheque.org/), and have served on the feature film programming panels for the [Melbourne International Film Festival](http://www.miff.com.au/) and the [Human Rights Arts & Film Festival (HRAFF)](http://www.hraff.org.au/). You can occasionally hear me hosting *The Graveyard Shift* or *Room With a View* on Melbourne’s 3RRR Radio.

I’m currently a PhD candidate in the School of Media and Communication at RMIT University, and a member of the Screen & Sound Cultures collaborative research group. My research focuses on persona and practice in comedy media.
